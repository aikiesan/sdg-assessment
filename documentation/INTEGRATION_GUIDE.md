# Integration Guide

This guide describes how to integrate the SDG Assessment Toolkit with external systems or partners (e.g., UN-Habitat, sustainability platforms).

## API Integration
- Use the REST API endpoints (see API_REFERENCE.md) for programmatic access to projects, assessments, and SDG data.
- Authentication is required for all API requests (token-based).

## Data Export
- Export assessment results as CSV or PDF for use in other systems.
- Custom export formats can be developed as needed.

## Embedding & White-Labeling
- The toolkit can be embedded in partner sites via iframe or API.
- Contact the team for white-labeling or custom branding options.

## Collaboration
- Partners can contribute to translations, feature requests, and funding.
- For deep integration, coordinate with the technical team for custom endpoints or data sharing agreements.

## Contact
- For integration support, contact the UIA technical team.
